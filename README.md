# Java Foundations Practice

## Overview

This repository is a structured learning path for mastering Java SE 8 fundamentals, core object-oriented concepts, and common APIs. It is designed to complement preparation for the **Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE 8 Programmer I (1Z0-808)** exam.
It includes step-by-step examples, practice exercises, and small portfolio-ready mini-projects.

The repository follows a **modular structure** where each numbered folder represents a major topic area, containing descriptive README files and well-commented Java source code. Topics progress from absolute basics to more advanced programming concepts.

## Objectives

By working through this repository, you will:

* Understand Java syntax and structure.
* Apply core programming concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control flow.
* Write reusable, maintainable code using object-oriented principles.
* Work with collections, functional programming features, exception handling, and JDBC.
* Build and test small applications to reinforce learning.
* Gain the skills required to attempt the **OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I** exam.

```

Each module contains:

* **README.md** – Detailed explanation of concepts, with references to official Java SE 8 documentation and OCA exam topics.
* **Code Examples** – Java files demonstrating each concept with inline comments.
* **Practice Exercises** – Tasks to reinforce the topic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Java SE 8 JDK** installed ([Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html))
* **IDE** such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans
* Basic familiarity with programming concepts is helpful but not required

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-foundations-practice.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in your IDE.
3. Compile and run any `.java` file using:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

## Learning Approach

This repository is designed to be followed sequentially:

1. **Java Basics** – Learn syntax, variables, operators, and loops.
2. **Methods & OOP** – Understand modular coding and class-based design.
3. **Advanced OOP** – Master inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
4. **Data Structures** – Learn to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently.
5. **Functional Programming** – Use Java’s lambda expressions and streams for concise code.
6. **Exception Handling** – Handle runtime errors effectively.
7. **JDBC** – Connect Java to relational databases.
8. **Mini-Projects** – Apply your knowledge to practical, real-world problems.
